# Investments Planner

Investments planner is a single page application that allows users to create and login to a account and plan out a investment portfolio. This project utilizes a rails as a backend, and javascript frontend, and the Chart.js library to create a chart to show how much of a particular industry a user has invested in to in their portfolio. Investments in the portfolio can be added and and deleted, and the included chart will adapt to those changes made.

# Installation and Usage

After that, run `rails s` to start a rails server and open up `index.html` to use the project.
